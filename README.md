# Clouds-segmentation

This is a deep learning problem that we had to do during my initial training in Data Science but we could not finish it during the training.
It was taken from a kaggle competition issued my Max Planck Instute.
The aim was to identify 4 categories of clouds (flower, gravel, sugar, fish) from satellite images.

We used a U-net model but we had some troubles with the masks predictions.

I limited the model to picture containing one type of cloud for the moment as my computer performance were too low (no GPU) and, as a first step, to validate the method.

I am still looking for some help/support to finish this project !

Thanks

Thibaut
